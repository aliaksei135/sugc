    <p><b>Hi {{ member.first_name }}</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Thanks for applying to fly! You've been selected to fly on <b>{{ flying_date }}</b></p>
    <p><b>{{ driver.first_name }}</b> will be driving, their phone number is {{ driver.phone_number }}.
      <b>Please text your driver to confirm you are still planning to go by <b>{{ deadline }}</b>, otherwise your place
      may be given to someone else!</p>

    <p>For those of you who are flying for the first time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>You must have done a negative COVID test up to 2 days before going flying. You must also wear a mask within
        the glider.</b>
      <li>Meet at the SUSU shop at 8 am on your day. Check your phone in the morning for any updates and do not be late
        otherwise the driver will leave without you!
      <li>If you cannot make it, please let your driver know ASAP so that they can find a replacement. It is very unfair
        on those who are not selected to fly if you just don't turn up on the day or only cancel the evening before.
      <li>If it is cold then it will be very cold and there is no food. Be sure to wrap up warm and take some lunch with
        you. Take lots of removable layers as you will be out for the whole day, but can leave things in the car if they
        aren't needed!
      <li>If it looks sunny, take sunglasses and a sunhat. Sunglasses are essential when flying and you can still get
        sunburnt on the airfield in the winter!
      <li>Wear sensible shoes. Walking boots with thick socks are a safe bet. If you wear converse or flimsy trainers,
        you will end up with cold wet feet for the whole day.
      <li>Take Â£5 cash to give to your driver. They are paying for petrol themselves so we ask passengers to contribute
        towards the driver's petrol. This is a separate payment to the flying fees, please don't include it on any
        payments to SUGC!
      <li>You don't need to take any money to pay for flying - you will be asked to pay by bank transfer after the
        day/weekend.
    </ul>

    <p>Please let us know if you have any problems by replying to this email or getting in touch with one of the
      committee.</p>
    <p>We hope you have a great day!</p>
