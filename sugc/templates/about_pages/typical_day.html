      <h3>Setup the airfield</h3>
      <p>
        After an approximately hour long drive up to the airfield, we help set up for the day of flying.
        If you're new to gliding don't worry, you won't be asked to do anything you don't understand yet!
        There are three main things that need setting up: the winch, the launch point and the gliders themselves.

      <h3>Pack back up</h3>
      <p>
        After flying, we need to put everything back as it was before we came and secure the gliders, so they are still
        there next time we come! We make our way back after this is done.

      <h3>Pay your flying fees</h3>
      <p>
        As much as we would like to make your flying free, we can't :( . After your flying day, you should see a
        corresponding
        fees entry on your profile page. Please pay your fees in a timely manner!
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't forget to make sure you've added some availability so you can go flying again!
