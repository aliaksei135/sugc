      <p>SUGC is the Southampton University Gliding Club. We are here to offer the best quality gliding at the best
        price, while having a great day all in conjunction with each other! The Club re-established in 2015 and over
        1000 tremendous flights have occurred since! SUGC glides at Shalbourne, which there is a link to on the
        homepage. Gliding is suitable for anyone from any background from any degree! No knowledge needed! We have
        weekly socials of great success along with some fantastic trips with other Uniâ€™s and independent trips!</p>

      <h3>Who is SUGC for?</h3>
      <p>SUGC is a club that can give you a unique experience unlike any other. We are a friendly club that welcomes
        everyone. Beginners are helped to achieve their ambitions while experienced pilots will not be held back! Once
        solo, some pilots like to fly cross country, some like to fly upside down, and some just like to potter around
        the sky for a bit of peace and quiet. Whatever your goals, this is the place to be!</p>
      <p>We allow any Southampton University students to join, regardless of course, age, or anything else. Of course,
        there are some restrictions beyond our control, but if you are over 14 years old and have no medical conditions
        which prevent you getting a driving license, you can fly solo! Many disabilities can also be accommodated in
        gliding. Check out our <a href="{% url 'faq' %}">FAQ</a> for more info.</p>
